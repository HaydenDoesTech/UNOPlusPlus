**Build Instructions**<br>
This program utilizes CMake, SFML, and C++. There are many programs out there you can run this program on, and the steps may vary. However, you'll want to make sure you do these basic items.
- Our GitHub repository already has all of the files you will need.
- All you need to do is download the code (or clone the repository) into your IDE of choice.
- Then, have your IDE load the CMake project and generate files locally on your computer.
- Then, build the program. Give it some time as it may take awhile.
- Finally, run the program! You're off to the races.
