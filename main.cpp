 * Description: This programming assignment requires the development of a      *
 *              graphical application. For this, we have chosen to make a      *
 *              game -- and why not something with a good variety of colors,   *
 *              text, some shapes, and of course, some good-old board game fun *
 *              virtualized? Welcome to UNO in C++!                            *
